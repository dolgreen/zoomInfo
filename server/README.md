# To start
  ### run
  -  `npm i`
  -  `npm run start:dev`

# explaining

Here the backend communicates with a file, so as long as you have this file named users.json in a directory called db it will work.

## update
  Im keeping the example file but I moved to mongoDB (atlas) so if you need any help feel free to contact me.


### Pay attention

if you want to connect to a real db you can remove the file and connect to your favorite db and as long as you modify the data returned to be the same type (User[])
it should be fine.

Good luckðŸ’
